# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
This is my final project of MSc Data Science. In this project i am trying to predict the credit card default of customers using various machine learning models. The data set is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data contains details of credit card clients in Taiwan which include the demographic details of customers, history of payments etc.
