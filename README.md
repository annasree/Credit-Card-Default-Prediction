# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
This is my final project of MSc Data Science. In this project i am trying to predict the credit card default of customers using various machine learning models. The data set is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data contains details of credit card clients in Taiwan which include the demographic details of customers, history of payments etc. The dataset is a Microsoft excel file of size 1.4MB. It contains 30000 instances and 23 features.

The data set was uploaded in the repository. 
The code file was uploaded multiple times as the project progressed, after importing the data exploratory data anlysis was conducted to understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns within the dataset. After EDA data preprocessing steps were carried out, including feature scaling and adressing class imbalance.
Kept Random forest as a base model, Trained and tested the dataset with XGBoost, CatBoost and AdaBoost models. Compared the result before parameter tuning and after tuning.
Checked the feature importance of each model.
